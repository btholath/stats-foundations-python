"""
Variance and Covariance of Height and Weight

Variance of X (Height): which is just the spread of height values.
Covariance of X with Y (Height vs. Weight): which shows how height and weight vary together.


Metric	                Meaning
Variance of X	        How much height varies across individuals
Covariance of X with Y	Whether taller people tend to weigh more (positive value)

If cov_xy is positive, height and weight tend to increase together.
If cov_xy is negative, taller people tend to weigh less (unlikely here).
If cov_xy is near zero, there's no consistent relationship.
