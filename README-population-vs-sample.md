Understanding the symbols used in **population vs. sample statistics** is foundational to inferential analysis. These symbols help distinguish whether you're working with the entire dataset (population) or just a subset (sample), which directly affects how you interpret results and calculate uncertainty.

## ðŸ“Š Population vs. Sample: Key Symbols & What They Represent

| Concept                     | Population Symbol | Sample Symbol | Meaning / Use Case |
|----------------------------|-------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| **Size**                   | \( N \)           | \( n \)        | Number of units in population vs. sample |
| **Mean**                   | \( \mu \)         | \( \bar{x} \)  | Average value of a variable |
| **Standard Deviation**     | \( \sigma \)      | \( s \)        | Spread of data around the mean |
| **Variance**               | \( \sigma^2 \)    | \( s^2 \)      | Square of standard deviation |
| **Proportion**             | \( P \)           | \( \hat{p} \)  | Fraction of population/sample with a trait |
| **Correlation**            | \( \rho \)        | \( r \)        | Strength of relationship between variables |
| **Covariance**             | \( \text{Cov}(X,Y) \) | Same for both | Joint variability of two variables |
| **Standard Error**         | â€”                 | \( SE \)       | Estimate of variability in sample mean |
| **Confidence Interval**    | â€”                 | \( \bar{x} \pm z \cdot SE \) | Range likely to contain population mean |
| **Z-score / T-score**      | \( Z \)           | \( t \)        | Standardized value for hypothesis testing |

### ðŸ§  Why It Matters

- **Population parameters** (e.g., \( \mu, \sigma \)) are usually unknownâ€”we estimate them using **sample statistics** (e.g., \( \bar{x}, s \)).
- Inferential statistics is all about using sample data to **make educated guesses** about population parameters.
- The distinction is critical when calculating **confidence intervals**, **p-values**, and **test statistics**.

### ðŸ§  Why This Matters in Practice

- **Mu vs. X-bar**: When estimating average customer spend, you use \( \bar{x} \) from your sample to infer \( \mu \) for the full population.
- **Sigma vs. s**: Sample standard deviation \( s \) helps estimate population variability \( \sigma \), especially in forecasting or risk modeling.
- **P-hat vs. P**: In churn analysis, \( \hat{p} \) is the observed churn rate in your sample, used to infer the true churn rate \( P \).
